<h1>Rhino Documentation</h1>

_Listed below is the Documentation you need to install and run Rhino at home._

<h3> Downloading Rhino: </h3>

_Downloading Rhino is already listed on Princeton Websites. So to install the program follow the instructions here:_ [Windows](https://archcomp.princeton.edu/software/install-rhino/install-rhino-6/), [Mac](https://archcomp.princeton.edu/software/install-rhino/install-rhino-6-mac/)

<h3> Running Rhino abroad: </h3>

_Rhino runs on a_ [_zoo server_](https://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/home) _; therefore, it needs to be connected to a specific network to work. So when you're at Princeton, it is straightforward to run Rhino because you are most likely connected to the network there. At home, however, this is a little more complicated. For this reason, we need a VPN._

1. Go to the following link and download the appropriate VPN software for your computer: https://vpn.princeton.edu/global-protect/getsoftwarepage.esp
2. Set the VPN by following the instructions found in this page under the section <ins>Starting and disconnecting from GlobalProtect on your computer</ins>: https://princeton.service-now.com/service?sys_id=KB0012373&id=kb_article 
3. Now launch Rhino. Once Rhino is running, you can disconnect from the server. But anytime you want to open a new rhino window, you must be connected to the VPN.
